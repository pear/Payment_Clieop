Clieop03 is a dutch standard for import and export of payment orders.
Clieop is a standard of Interpay (www.interpay.nl - www.i-pay.nl) and 
the Postbank (www.postbank.nl). Also most Dutch banking software can 
import these payment orders.

Every line in the clieop file is exactly 50 characters. Alfanumeric fields are
filled up with spaces at the right side. Numeric values are filled up with
zeros on the leftside.

Clieop is using the EDI-fact formula to store the data.

All Banks that are operating in the Netherlands are supporting clieop3. With
the introducion of the Euro previous versions of clieop (01, 02  and 03 with
Dutch Guilders) are obsolete and can no longer be used to send to the bank.

Clieop03 (with as payment currency EURO) is currently the only valid way to
export payment orders (both incasso and deposit) for sending them to the
bank.

NOTE: The generated clieop file is only useable in the Netherlands
